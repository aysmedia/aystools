# Downloading
You have two options for downloading the AYS Tools.  

NOTE: Whenever possible, we recommend that you use option #1, the git repository download directly from your server.  

1. Use git right from your server to retrieve the source code. To do so, change to the directory where you want to install and run the following command:  

        git clone git://github.com/aysmedia/aystools.git .  

2. Visit the following URL to download the most recent source code archive: https://github.com/aysmedia/aystools/archives/master  


# Installation
1. Please choose from one of the following two options:  

    If you used git to retrieve the source code in the previous step, just change to the directory where you ran the git command and your files are already waiting for you.  

    If you downloaded the source code in the previous step, you will now need to upload the archive to your server and then unpack it into the folder where you wish to install.  


# Upgrading
You have two options for upgrading the AYS Tools.  

1. Use git right from your server to upgrade. To do so, just run the following command from within the directory where you installed the AYS Tools:
